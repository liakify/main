== PROJECT: Splitwiser

---

== Overview

Splitwiser is an application for simplifying payments made between groups of friends.
It gurantees that each person does not need to make any unnecessary transfers to settle their debts.
The user interacts with it using a command line, and is targeted at users who prefer command line utilities.
It however has a nice JavaFX Graphical User Interface(GUI) to report details visually and intuitvely.
It has >10k lines of code.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the debt simplification algorithm.
** What it does: It simplifies all debts optimally in each activity.
** Justification: This is the core feature, and the main point of the entire application.
** Details: The algorithm scales well to huge amounts of participants and expenses, and can be mathematically proved to always minimize the money everyone has to touch in order to settle all debts in the group. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/101[#101]
** Credits: https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2062204/623903.pdf[This paper].

* *Major enhancement*: Added a command to settle debts
** What it does: The `settle` command helps users record settlements of debts after they pay each other in person.
** Justification: It is a core feature to be able to record special payments between two people specifically to settle debts.
** Details: The algorithm shows how much is owed. `settle` can either automatically settle all debts between two people, or settle a particular amount between two people. It also checks for valid settlements; so no settlement can make debts worse in accord with our philosophy of always simplifying debts. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/190[#190]

* *Major enhancement*: Added persistent internal state for primary key tracking.
** What it does: It keeps track of important variables across startups of the application.
** Justification: We require a unique identifier for every person and activity for the purpose of storing activities, contacts, etc. We need a way to store this across startups so it is unique.
** Details: This ID record for every object has to persist so that we don't end up assigning repeated IDs to different people/activities. We also need to perform validation on this data. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/80[#80] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/104[#104]

* *Major enhancement*: Update bindings for every command to mesh with the algorithm.
** Details: The other commands have to interact with the algorithm properly. For example, the `delete` or `activity` commands need to do their jobs and not mess up the debts. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/119[#119] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/120[#120] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/110[#110]

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
** Details: You can press the up and down arrow keys to browse previous commands executed. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/53[#53]
