== PROJECT: SplitWiser

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an activity tracking bill-splitting system called *SplitWiser*.
This enhanced application enables people who participate in group activities together with shared expenses to split the cost evenly without the hassle of manual calculation. +
 +
This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write codes for the `invite`, `disinvite` and `delete` features. The following sections illustrate
these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements. +
 +
Note the following formatting used in this document. +

`delete`: A grey highlight indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to invite contacts to current viewed activity*
** What it does: allows the user to `invite` multiple contacts at once to the current viewed activity.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the participants in an activity is not static as people can join midway during an activity and the app should provide a convenient way to `invite` them without creating a new activity.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation was challenging due to the fact that it depends on the user's screen.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to disinvite contacts from current viewed activity*
** What it does: allows the user to `disinvite` multiple contacts at once from the current viewed activity.
** Justification: It is sort of an "undo" function if user mistakenly invited the wrong person to an activity. Since `invite` allows multiple invitees at once, an "undo" function will be inconvenient as it removes everyone that was invited previously, `disinvite` allows user to remove particular participants that was invited mistakenly to the activity conveniently.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation was challenging due to the fact that it depends on the user's screen.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to delete contact/activity/expense in an activity*
** What it does: allows the user to `delete` contact/activity or soft-delete expense one at a time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly especially for the deletion of expense. Since money is a sensitive issue, the soft deletion of expense allows the expense to still be visible but striked-off so it remains as a history for accountability.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation was challenging due to the fact that it depends on the user's screen.
