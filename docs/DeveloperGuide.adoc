Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::uicomponent[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` class that comprises parts from two categories:

* _Common parts_ that are displayed regardless of the current application context, e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,`StatusBarFooter` etc.
* _Contextual parts_ that are only displayed in the respective application context, e.g. `ActivityListPanel`, `PersonDetailsPanel`.

All of these UI classes, including `MainWindow` itself, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The _common_ UI classes are shown above `MainWindow` in the above class diagram, whereas the _contextual_ UI classes are shown below `MainWindow`.

All UI classes are built upon the JavaFX GUI framework. The structure of each UI part `X` is defined in a matching `X.fxml` file in the folder `src/main/resources/view`. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

To create a visually cohesive and pleasant GUI, custom CSS styling rules were also employed to style each UI part individually. These stylesheets may be found as `.css` files in the folder `src/main/resources/view``.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for some changes to `Model` data so that relevant UI parts may be re-rendered with the modified data.
* Parses the returned `CommandResult` to perform appropriate additional actions, such as exiting the application or switching the contextual part being displayed.
** The behaviour of the `MainWindow` part is further detailed in <<GUI commands: List and View features>>.
// end::uicomponent[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `Context` object that represents the current application context.
* stores a JSON serializable `InternalState` object in order to keep track of primary key counters for both `Person` and `Activity`.
* stores the Address Book and Activity Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
`Activity` and `Expense` keeps track of the people involved by storing IDs instead of objects, hence there is no direct dependency on the `Person` class.
[]

[NOTE]
Strictly speaking, `Context` only stores a single `Optional<Object>`, which can only be an `Activity` or `Person`. Hence, it is not actually possible for `Context` to contain both and `Activity` and `Person`, unlike what Figure 7 might suggest.
[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::activityclass[]
=== Activity class
`Activity` is a class used to store activities and their details. It contains the following information:

* Primary Key

Each `Activity` has a unique primary key used by external classes to identify and access them, without unnecessary dependencies.

* Title

Title of the activity is stored using `Title`, which runs validations to ensure that the title is valid. Currently, the only restriction for the title is that it can't be blank.

* Participants

Participants are saved internally under `participantIds`, which only stores the primary key of `Person` involved.

* Expenses incurred by this activity

Expenses are stored as `Expense`. Refer to <<Expense class>> for more details.

* Outstanding balance for each participant

The balance of each participants are stored internally under `participantBalances`.

All `Activity` objects are stored in `ActivityBook`.

The following class diagram describes the implementation of `Activity`.

.Structure of the Activity class
image::ActivityClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of participants

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only storing the primary key of participants
** *Pros*: Minimizes dependency and potential bugs.
** *Cons*: More difficult for external classes to retrieve participant objects if necessary.
** *Reason for choice*: Storing entire object can potentially cause bugs, as there are no mechanisms to ensure the consistency of data between `Person` object in `Activity` and `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the entire `Person` object inside the `Activity`.
** *Pros*: Easier to implement. Object can be easily retrieved when necessary.
** *Cons*: Creates extra dependency between classes. More prone to error.
// end::activityclass[]

// tag::createactivity[]
=== Create activity feature
Mechanism to create activity is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Activity()` -- Constructor used to create a new `Activity`.

All `Activity` models are stored inside `ActivityBook`.

When creating an activity, the title must be specified. It is optional to include participants, as they can be invited separately using the invite command. Refer to <<Invite/Disinvite feature>> for more information.

Adding of participant uses both exact-match and keyword-based search. First, the search term passed in is used to find an contact with an exact matching name. If no exact match is found, the search term is split into keywords via whitespace. Obtained keywords are then used to search the AddressBook for a matching person. The person is added in as a participant only if there is one exact match. Otherwise, a warning message will be displayed and no participant will be added for this set of keywords.

The aforementioned mechanism was applied to minimize friction for users in using this feature. In early stages of development, it was concluded that making users type in the full name every time was seen as overly tedious. Making use of keyword-based search ensures that the users will only have to type in minimum amount of information to add a person.

Exact matching is always used first to overcome a specific edge case where a contact could not be added, if its name was a substring of another contact's name. Using exact-matching before applying keyword-based matching helps avoid this problem.

Here is a sample use case in creating an expense:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `activity t/Breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named Breakfast in the activity book, with David as a participant.

**Step 3.** The user executes `activity t/Lunch p/Alex p/David` command to create an activity named Lunch in the activity book. In this case, as there are two contacts with the name "Alex", this search term is considered invalid, and only David is added into the Lunch activity as a participant.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how creating activity works:

.Sequence diagram for creating an activity
image::CreateActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ActivityCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram encapsulates the high level logic of the create activity operation.

The following activity diagram encapsulates the high level logic of finding the correct contact to add as participant, for each keyword supplied.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Finding the correct contact to add

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can use keywords to specify the contact to be added.
** *Pros*: Improves usability.
** *Cons*: Difficult to implement. Necessary to handle multiple edge cases.
** *Reason for choice*: Forcing users to specify exact full name was deemed to be too tedious, especially when adding multiple participants.

* **Alternative 2:** Users must type in the exact full name of the contact to be added.
** *Pros*: Easy to implement. Low possibility of bugs.
** *Cons*: Significantly decreases usability of the application.
// end::createactivity[]

// tag::expense[]
=== Expense class
`Expense` is a class used to record expense information. It contains the following information:

* Paying person

Each expense must be paid by someone, which is recorded as `personId` internally. As the name suggests, only the primary key of the `Person` paying is stored.

* Other involved people

Each expense also involves some people who will be taken to owe money to the paying person. This is recorded as `involvedIds[]` internally, which only stores the primary key of each involved person.

* Amount

The amount of money spent. The value of an `Amount` is stored as a `double`, and must be non-negative. Refer to <<Limitations of `double`>> for a more in depth analysis the numerical errors that may arise due to the limitations of this representation.

* Description

The description of an expense. The description may be blank if the user chooses to not describe what it is about.

* Deleted flag

This flag tracks whether an expense has been marked as deleted or not, and is stored as a boolean value `isDeleted`. For accountability purposes, we do not allow an `Expense` to be deleted from an `Activity` entirely, and instead use this flag to keep track of it. Expenses can only be fully deleted by deleting the entire activity.

* Settlement flag

SplitWiser supports 2 main types of "expenses": one is an actual expense, and the other is a transaction between people to pay off debts. The latter is what we call a settlement, and is indicated by the boolean `isSettlement`.

The following diagram describes the structure of the `Expense` class:

.Structure of the Expense class
image::ExpenseClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to actually represent an `Expense`
* **Alternative 1**: An expense is represented by a paying person and an amount. Everyone in the activity is then taken to owe the paying person an equal portion of the paid amount.
** **Pros:** Extremely simple to use.
** **Cons:** Overly idealised and simplified and assumes that everyone is involved in every expense. This severely hinders its utility in real scenarios as this is unable to account for even simple deviations in debt patterns.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: An expense is represented by a paying person, amount, and a list of people involved. Everyone who is specified to be involved then owes an equal portion of the paid amount to the paying person.
** **Pros:** Reasonable flexibility as it enables a wide range of possible expense sharing combinations.
** **Cons:** Forces equal split among participants in the involved list, which is still going to result in limited utility in some real scenarios. A simple example would be that a group of people can have a meal together but each person's meal would cost a different amount.
** **Reason for choice:** Although the above con can be a very real issue from a user's standpoint, we believe this is the best balance between flexibility and usability.

* **Alternative 3**: An expense is represented by a paying person, an amount, a list of paying people and the amount each person should pay back the paying person.
** **Pros:** Ultimate flexibility and addresses the con above.
** **Cons:** Significantly complicates the backend management of expenses. While this is something that will definitely be addressed in future versions of SplitWiser (e.g. adding a new `varexpense` command that enables this), we opted for a simpler version of `Expense` due to time constraints. The areas that need to be taken into consideration include (but may not limited to):
*** Design of the command for the user in a way that is intuitive
*** Managing the event that the amount list does not add up to the amount paid
*** GUI representation of the more generalised version of `Expense`
// end::expense[]

// tag::createexpense[]
=== Create expense feature
The mechanism to create expenses is facilitated by `Expense`. Each `Activity` stores a list of `Expense` called `expenses`, representing the expenses incurred in the course of this activity.

When creating an expense, an amount and at least one person (the paying person) must be specified, and information about an expense cannot be modified once it is created. The only exception to this would be to delete an expense, but expenses also cannot be un-deleted once marked as deleted.



In terms of the name searching logic to actually identify who is involved, it is identical to that which is used in the creation of activities (see <<Create activity feature>>), but with a few key differences: +

1. The expense will only be created if **all** sets of keywords result in a unique match. For instance, if the user specifies `p/John Doe p/Mary p/James`, but only the keyword `James` does not successfully identify a unique person, then the entire expense will not be created.
2. The search scope is contextual. If creating an expense outside an activity context, it will search for matches in the entire Address Book. However, in an activity context, it will only search for matches among existing activity participants.

Here, it is important to realise that duplicating the name searching logic ensures a consistent user experience, as the user has no reason to expect that the search behaviour would be different. For example, if `john` was successfully used to identify a contact named `John Doe` when creating an activity, the user has no reason to expect that `john` would not be able to identify `John Doe` for an expense.

Here is a sample use case in creating an expense:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `activity t/breakfast p/Jo p/Bob p/Alice` command to create an activity named breakfast with 3 participants added to the activity. The context is then switched to this new activity.

**Step 3.** The user executes `expense p/Jo e/10` to indicate that Jo paid $10 for something (unnamed as description is not specified) that is shared by everyone i.e. Bob and Alice. This happens because the default behaviour for `expense` is to assume everyone is involved if no one else is specified explicitly. `expense` command calls `Activity#addExpense()` and adds the new expense into the activity. The debt algorithm will then instantly recompute the debt matrix (see <<Debt simplification algorithm>>) for the activity, and store the expense object inside the activity's expense list (i.e. `expenses`).

The following sequence diagram shows how the expense adding operation works:

.Sequence diagram for adding an expense
image::ExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ExpenseCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram encapsulates the high level logic of the expense adding operation:

// end::createexpense[]
// tag::algorithm[]
=== Debt simplification algorithm
The algorithm is inspired by https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2062204/623903.pdf[this paper].

We can gurantee the removal of all needless payments.
The amount of money each person has to hand is minimized.
We are unable to minimize the number of transactions made.
The paper gives an overview of that problem and why it is NP-complete (subset-sum).

==== Operation details
The amounts each person owes to another is represented by a graph in an adjacency matrix.
The algorithm represents the payments to be made as a matrix.
There are some other data structures to facilitate its operation, but the code is generally well commented and they are not major player so we will skip them.

To rephrase our gurantee in this context will be: we want to minimize weights.
That is, the total amount of money someone will have to touch is minimized.

The lower bound for the amount someone has to handle is the balance.
We create a balance sheeet for the users which is expanded as people enter the activity.
Each expense added, the algorithm retrieves from it:
* who is involved,
* who paid,
* how much has been paid,
splits everything correctly, and updates all the data structures appropriately.

Someone's balance is positive if he received more than he owes.
Then, a negative balance indicates them lending more than they received.
The algorithm simply finds any two people whose balances have opposing signs.
It is unimportant what is the magnitude of their balances (we do not need to take them in any order).
What then happens is then the person with the smallest magnitude of balance neutralizes his balance by paying or being paid by the other party.
The algorithm terminates when all balances are 0.

==== Proof of optimality
This is a short proof of optimality since we want it to be called "algorithm", not "heuristic".

In essence what we are constructing is a bipartite graph.
The algorithm never allows someone who owes to be paid, or someone who is owed to pay even more.
Hence we can classify all nodes into those with leaving edges (payers) and those with entering edges (payee).

In a bipartite graph the amount each person handles is minimized.
To see why, we have to keep in mind that the algorithm always neutralizes one of the parties' balance.
That is to say, we will not be left with the case where someone who could pay off all his debts "overpaying".
In such a case, someone will then have to pay him back, which means it is no longer bipartite.

==== Time and Space complexity
We take O(N^2) space and O(N) time.
Updating of the balance sheet and matrices by the expense command is performed in O(1) time.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Precision

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Just use `double`.
** *Pros*: Easy, straightforward, good enough.
** *Cons*: Floating point precision might stack up.
** *Reason for choice*: For everyday purposes it is highly unlikely currencies (normally at most 2 decimal points) require any higher precision. This is for normal friends, not stockbrokers.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a `Rational` class for rational numbers.
** *Pros*: Guranteed precision.
** *Cons*: Seems overkill and needlessly over-engineered.

// tag::guicommands[]
=== GUI commands: List and View features

==== Introduction
To reduce the amount of typing required of the user, it was decided that the app would support _contextual commands_ that operate differently based on the data the user was currently viewing.

The List and View commands (collectively, _GUI commands_) were thus introduced to enable the user to switch between different views (panels) of the app, of which there are four:

* Contact list (`PersonListPanel`) - displays brief information (e.g. name, mobile number) of every tracked contact
* Activity list (`ActivityListPanel`) - displays brief information (e.g. title) of every tracked activity
* Contact details (`PersonDetailsPanel`) - displays full details of a specific contact, including that contact's activity history
* Activity details (`ActivityDetailsPanel`) - displays full details of a specific activity, including all expenses, settlements and required transfers

These mechanism of GUI commands is facilitated by a combination of three classes, `MainWindow`, `Model` and `Context`.

==== Context class

`Context` is an immutable utility class introduced to describe the nature of the current view of the app. It stores state information about the current `ContextType` and an optional `Object` of interest, and is essential for the UI, Model and Logic components to maintain a consistent

A `Context` may be instantiated in one of three ways:

* invoking the factory method `newListContactContext` or `newListContactContext`, which creates a new `Context` of type `LIST_ACTIVITY` or `LIST_CONTACT` respectively
* invoking the constructor with an `Activity`, which creates a new `Context` of type `VIEW_ACTIVITY` with that activity
* invoking the constructor with a `Person`, which creates a new `Context` of type `VIEW_CONTACT` with that contact

.Class diagram of `Context` class and `ContextType` enum
image::ContextClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

The `Context` class exposes relevant getter methods `Context#getType`, `Context#getActivity` and `Context#getContact`. This enables contextual commands and the UI to retrieve the `Activity` or `Person` of interest, thus supporting contextual behaviour of the UI and other commands.

During the execution of any command that changes the active view of the app, a new `Context` is created, with the relevant `Activity` or `Person`, if any. The command then updates the `Model` with the method `Model#setContext`.

The updated `Context` of the `Model` is then wrapped as part of the `CommandResult` and returned to the `MainWindow`, which prompts the UI to perform additional actions.

==== UI context switching

After executing a command successfully, the `MainWindow` receives a `CommandResult`, which it uses to determine if any additional actions need to be performed.

If the `CommandResult` contains a `Context`, then `MainWindow` switches the currently displayed panel out for the appropriate panel specified by the `ContextType`. The following activity diagram encapsulates the additional actions that may be performed as a result of `MainWindow` parsing the `CommandResult`.

.Activity diagram for UI after successful command execution
image::ContextSwitchActivityDiagram.png[]

==== List feature

During execution, the List command creates the specified `Context` (either of type `LIST_ACTIVITY` or `LIST_CONTACT`). It then updates the `Model` with the new `Context`, alongside the `FilteredList` of `Activity` or `Person` respectively.

As `MainWindow` observes both `FilteredList`, JavaFX will automatically re-render the contained card entries when the respective list undergoes structural changes. The updated `Context` is then returned to `MainWindow` via the `CommandResult`, where it switches to displaying the specified list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of a user intending to view the list of activities.

Step 1. The user launches *SplitWiser* for the first time, which defaults to displaying the list of contacts.

Step 2. The user executes `list a/` to prompt the app to display the full list of activities.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the role of the Logic and Model components in the execution of GUI commands. The role of the UI component is detailed in <<UI context switching>>.

.Sequence diagram for listing all activities
image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ListCommand` and `ListCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

==== View feature

The View feature is intended to be used in tandem with the List feature, and displays the full details of the entry at a specified display index of the specified list. Note however, this takes into account the filter applied on the specified list, e.g. from the Find feature.

During execution of the View command, a new `Context` is created, along with the `Person` or `Activity` to be viewed, obtained from the `Model`. The rest of the execution follows that of the List command.

Given below is an example usage scenario of a user intending to view the second activity.

Step 1. The user launches *SplitWiser* for the first time, which defaults to displaying the list of contacts.

Step 2. The user executes `list a/` to prompt the app to display the full list of activities.

Step 3. The user executes `view a/2` to view the full details of the second activity, which succeeds if the list contains two or more activities.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: representing the current context state

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creating an immutable `Context` class as a state container to store the appropriate information.
** Pros: Lightweight; context state can be easily passed between components that require access, as it is encapsulated entirely within `Context`.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the `Context` state in a designated central component, e.g. the `ModelManager`, and exposing relevant methods to other components.
** Pros: Trivial to implement.
** Cons: Tightly couples all components that require access to the context state to the central component, complicating testing.
// end::guicommands[]

// tag::findfeature[]
=== Find feature

The find mechanism is facilitated by the combination of three classes `MainWindow`, `Model` and `Context`.

`Context` is an immutable utility class that describes the nature of the current view of the app. Refer to <<List feature>> for more information about `Context`.

During execution, the Find command checks the current `Context` from `Model`. If the current context is `LIST_ACTIVITY`, the command will search for `Activity` using the supplied search terms. If the current context is `LIST_CONTACT`, the command will search for `Contacts` using the supplied search terms. Otherwise, the command is used on invalid context and will throw an error. If the command is executed in a valid context, it will update the `FilteredList` to contain only the matching results. As `MainWindow` tracks both `FilteredList`, JavaFX will automatically re-render the contained card entries when the respective list undergoes structural changes.

The Find command uses keyword-based matching to search for the correct results. If any of the keywords in the search term matches the title/name of the activity/contact, it will be included in the search results.

Given below is an example usage scenario of a user intending to find a specific activity.

Step 1. The user launches the `SplitWiser` application for the first time, which defaults to displaying the list of contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command string `list a/` to prompt the app to display the full list of activities.

Step 3. The user executes the command string `find keven` to prompt the app to search for all activities that contains the word "keven" in the title.

The following activity diagram encapsulates the high level logic of the find operation.

.Activity diagram for find command
image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to specify search type (Activity/Contact)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Rely on current context to decide which type of object to search for. Only works when in either of the list context.
** *Pros*: More intuitive for user, since the find command searches for the current type of object being viewed. Less typing is needed if user wants to continuously search in the same context.
** *Cons*: Harder to implement, extra dependencies with `Context` class.
** *Reason for choice*: Users are more likely to carry out multiple searches, especially when creating an Activity and searching for correct contacts to add.

* **Alternative 2:** Pass in an extra argument to specify what type of object one is looking for.
** *Pros*: Easier to implement, reduced dependency.
** *Cons*: Command gets less user-friendly and longer. Successive find command gets tedious to implement.
// end::findfeature[]

// tag::invitedisinvite[]
=== Invite/Disinvite feature
==== Implementation

The invite/disinvite mechanism is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Activity#invite()` -- Invites a person to the activity.
* `Activity#disinvite()` -- Disinvites a person from the activity.

These operations are exposed in the `Activity` class as `Activity#invite()` and `Activity#disinvite()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the invite/disinvite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `activity t/breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named breakfast with `David` as the sole participant which is stored in the `activityList`.

Step 3. The user executes `invite p/Louis p/Mary...` to invite more participants into the current viewed activity. The `invite` command calls `Activity#invite()` which then modifies the `activityList` with the new participants and is stored in the `ActivityBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the invite operation works:

image::InviteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `InviteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 4. The user decides that inviting some contacts was a mistake or they has not been involved in any of the expenses in the activity. Hence the user decides to remove them from the activity by executing the `disinvite` command.

Step 5. The user executes `disinvite p/Louis p/David ...` to remove participant(s) from the current activity. The `disinvite` command calls `Activity#disinvite()` which then modifies the `activityList` and is stored in the `ActivityBook`.

NOTE: The sequence diagram for the disinvite operation is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an invite command:

NOTE: The activity diagram for the disinvite command is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How invite & disinvite executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contextual based invite/disinvite based on current viewed activity.
** Pros: More user-friendly. User does not have to keep specifying which activity to invite the participants to each time an invite command is made.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Have to consider which activity to invite the participants to based on the current viewed activity.

* **Alternative 2:** Invite/disinvite based on user specifying the activity number.
** *Pros*: Easy to implement.
** *Cons*: Have to keep retyping activity number if multiple invites/disinvites are needed.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the invite/disinvite commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the participant's ID in the activity instead of participant's name.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Have to map participant's ID to participant's name. Hard to search for participant's specific ID when given name.

* **Alternative 2:** Use list to store participants instead of ID
** *Pros*: Easy to implement. Reuse what is already in the codebase and we do not need to create additional Unique ID key for each participant to identify them.
** *Cons*: Might create duplicate person object when reading from multiple json files if not implemented properly.

=== Delete feature
==== Implementation

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`, `ActivityBook`, as well as `Activity`. +
The items that will be deleted can be contact/activity/expense depending on your current display.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.  `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `list c/` command to display list contacts screen.

Step 3. The user executes `delete 1` to delete the contact at the first index, he/she will be deleted if he/she is not involved in any activity.

Step 4. The user executes `list a/` to display list activities screen.

Step 5. The user executes `delete 1` again, but this time the activity at the first index will be deleted instead.

Step 6. The user views an activity at the second index using `view a/2`

Step 7. The user executes `delete 1` again, but this time the expense at the first index will be *soft* deleted instead.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command for deletion of activity:

image::DeleteContactActivityDiagram.png[DeleteContactActivityDiagram, 229, 300]

NOTE: The activity diagram for deletion of expense and contact are omitted as they are similar to the deletion of activity.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How delete executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contextual based delete of contact/activity/expense based on current displayed screen.
** Pros: More user-friendly. User does not have to keep specifying what field to delete.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete based on user specifying which field to delete.
** *Pros*: Easy to implement.
** *Cons*: Have to keep retyping the field for deletion which is inconvenient.
// end::delete[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Limitations of `double`

It is important to note that SplitWiser in its current iteration uses `double` to represent expense amounts and debt values. While we maintain that this choice is sufficient for the intended uses of SplitWiser (i.e. to simplify debt calculations among friends), it is nonetheless essential as the developer to be aware of the issues that can arise with using such a representation.

Java uses the double precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point format to represent doubles, which internally comprises 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 52 mantissa bits. The finite digit nature of the mantissa consequently results in potential loss of precision when attempting to add or subtract numbers which have a wide range in magnitude. One example is as follows:

.Example activity
image::NumericalError.png[]

Here, if Alex attempts to settle the debt with David using `settle p/alex p/david`, the debt re-calculations will result the debt still being non-zero. In fact, if the user attempts executes another `settle p/alex p/david`, the debt still remains!

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Open the terminal.
.. Navigate to where you saved the jar file.
.. Execute the file with `java -jar <name of jar>` +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
